# Neovim Rock

## Neovim Configuration

This is a custom configuration project for the Neovim text editor.
Neovim is an advanced and extensible version of Vim, offering improvements in performance, extensibility, and user experience.

The projectâ€™s structure is well organized, with configuration files and plugins separated into logical directories. The configuration covers aspects such as:

- General Neovim options
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Autocommands (automatic events)
- Plugin configuration for different programming languages, such as **Python**, **Rust**, **Go**, **Elixir**, among others

Overall, the project is in good condition, but there are some areas where improvements could be made, such as:

- Optimizing option settings
- Simplifying plugin loading
